This is a fork of the orginal HTMLCleaner project found on http://htmlcleaner.sourceforge.net/

I modified this code to support more types of finder methods in the TagNode.java type, the core of this library. And JUnit tests for that as well.

I forked this code because it seemed like one of the better HTML parsers out there, implementing a decent (although incomplete) XPath implementation.

The original HTMLCleaner codebase appears to be abandoned, no changes since Feb 2011.
