# HtmlCleaner

Copyright (c) 2006-2012, Vladimir Nikic and the HtmlCleaner team. All rights reserved.

	This is a fork of the orginal HtmlCleaner project by Vladimir Nikic found on http://htmlcleaner.sourceforge.net/

It's been changed to support more types of finder methods in the TagNode.java 
type, the core of this library. And JUnit tests for that as well. I forked this
code because it seemed like one of the better HTML parsers out there, with a 
decent XPath implementation.

The original HtmlCleaner codebase appears to be abandoned, no changes since Feb 2011.
